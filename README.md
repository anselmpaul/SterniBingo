# SterniBingo ‚≠êüç∫

A stupid app for the stupid Sternburg Bingo.

I made this because I'm too lazy to manually search each number on the bingo sheets and because it was fun to overengineer this.
I want to thank my friends and roommates for bringing in their great ideas and supporting me throughout this journey.


Cheers üçª!
